            <h3>What is Matchmaking Bot?</h3>
            <p>
                Matchmaking bot is a Discord bot that creates lobbies for ranked competitive play. The ranking system is based off of the elo system used in Chess. Users can queue and match against each other to compete.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a lobby?</h3>
            <p>
                A lobby is a designated area in the Discord server where users can use the bot. These designated areas are Discord channels.
                Lobbies are seperated by Discord channels so the implmentor can have several competitions in one server.
                <br />
                e.g A server may have three lobbies in three seperate Discord channels. <br />
                #chess: a channel for chess. <br />
                #tetris: a channel for Tetris. <br />
                #street-fighter: a channel for Street Fighter.<br />
                Each lobby has a seperate queue and ranking system.
            </p>
            <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
            <h4>If you are an administrator:</h4>
            <p>
                Before the bot can be used in a channel, the channel must first be initialized as a lobby. A server administrator can initialize a lobby with "!f createlobby".
                After this command is used, the lobby can be used for matchmaking. I strongly suggest having a ruleset for the lobby for users to follow.
            </p>
            <h4>Queueing for a match within a server</h4>
            <p>
                1) To register to compete in a lobby, head over to an initialized lobby and use "!f register".  Once you register for a lobby, you can queue for a match. Different lobbies much be registered seperately.
            </p>
            <p>
                2) To queue for a match, go into an initialized lobby and use "!f queue". You will be placed into queue and matched against a player with a similar elo. The bot will DM you when a match is found. 
            </p>
            <p>
                3) When a match is found, contact the user the bot sends to you. Play a best out of 3 match in standard tournament rules or whatever rules the server specifies. 
            </p>
            <p>
                4) When the match is finished, the loser MUST directly message Matchmaking Bot "!f lose". You must DM the bot!
            </p>
            <p>
                5) If there is a disagreement, please contact a mod. 
            </p>
            <h4>Queueing for a match across servers</h4>
            <p>
                1) Register for cross server matchmaking with "!f register smashultimate"
            </p>
            <p>
                2) Queue for a cross server match with "!f queue smashultimate". You will be placed into queue and matched against users in any server that implements Matchmaking bot. The bot will DM you when a match is found.  
            </p>
            <p>
                3) When a match is found, contact the user the bot sends to you. Play a best out of 3 match in the Matchmaking bot offical rules below. 
            </p>
            <p>
                4) When the match is finished, the loser MUST directly message Matchmaking Bot "!f lose". You must DM the bot!
